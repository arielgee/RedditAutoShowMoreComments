# Reddit Auto Show More Comments
[WebExtension] Automatically clicks 'X more replies' and 'View more comments' buttons on Reddit.

This is a fork of the original Chrome extension by alythobani (Aly Thobani) at https://github.com/alythobani.

Someone requested this on Reddit, and I had some time to spare. https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxAddons/comments/1idyeul/can_someone_convert_this_extension_for_use_on/

### <u>From the original README</u>
